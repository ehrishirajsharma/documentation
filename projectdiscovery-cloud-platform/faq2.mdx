This FAQ covers questions and answers about general usage for ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform. Check out the Feature Summary for an overview of product capabilities. 

## Is **ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform** the same thing as Nuclei Cloud?
Yes! ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform is the updated name for the ProjectDiscovery Enterprise SaaS tool, replacing Nuclei Cloud.

## How do I run a scan? / How do I rerun a scan?

Scans run on the schedule specified when they are first created and can be modified in the Scan settings. 
The intervals available are daily, weekly, and monthly.

In addition, you can view the scan and use the Scan Now option to immediately queue a new scan.


## What configuration is required to enable scanning?

Completing the initial setup for your workspace (adding assets and selecting templates) walks you through creating your first scan for ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform. 
Adding scans can be created at any time with any assets you import using new or built-in system templates. 

Note: As part of your initial setup we recommend allowlisting the IP Scan Range provided under **Settings --> Domains --> IP Scan Range** to ensure access to your assets.


## How do I add assets? (What file upload formats do you support?)
We currently support the upload of a .txt file. This file cannot be larger than 5MB. 
You can also add assets through a manual import and through Integrations (currently GitHub, GitLab, and an S3 Bucket) 

## How do I create a new template?
ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform includes built-in system templates and supports the addition of new templates and template groups. 

 - To learn more about creating individual templates, review the documentation on creating templates. 
 - New template groups can be created using any templates that are in your ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform workspace. 


## How do I delete templates, scans, assets?
Scans can be deleted individually from the settings option for the selected scan. 
Assets can be deleted from the Asset Library by selecting the box next to the individual asset name. 
 
## How do I change settings for an existing scan?
To change the settings for an existing scan, click on the scan settings option next to the Scan name.
This allows you to change the frequency of scans, to add or remove asset groups, and add or remove template groups. 

## Can I create a new workspace?
Workspaces are the top level account element in ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform. At present, customers will typically be working from a single workspace. 
If a new workspace is required reach out to us for assistance (through in-product help or through support@projectdiscovery.io) 

## Does ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform remediate vulnerabilities?
ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform capabilities are focused on rapidly detecting assets and identifying vulnerabilities across your attack surface to 
help facilitate remediation for any issues identified through scanning. Some individual vulnerabilities provide recommended remediation steps.

## I forgot my password (How do I reset my password?)
Use the `Forgot Password?’ option that is available on the login page. 
If you still have issues accessing your account, reach out to support@projectdiscovery.io.

## How long does ProjectDiscovery Cloud Platform store my scanned data? (How/where is it stored?)
Any data that is imported is stored securely in a US-based cloud region and is currently retained indefinitely.
